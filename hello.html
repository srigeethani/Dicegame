    <h1>what is a web layout?</h1>

    <p>A website layout is the arrangement of all visual elements on a webpage. Through the intentional positioning of page elements, we can control the relationship between them to better guide the user experience. 

</p>

<p>Acting as a key component of web design, a layout determines the sequence in which page elements are registered among visitors, which elements draw the most attention, and the visual overall balance of the site. Because of its visual significance, a website layout can enhance a website’s message and usability.</p>

<p>Did you know that nearly all first impressions—94%, to be exact—are shaped by a website’s design? This just goes to show how much your layout influences how visitors perceive and interact with your site. Put plainly, a good website layout can lead visitors’ focus in the right direction—gravitating them toward what matters most first, and then continue to the following sections in order of significance. A layout can also be used to enhance your design, create interesting interactions and show that you’re up-to-date with web design trends.

    />

    <h4>03. Fullscreen image layout</h4>
    <p>With an extra large visual placed front-and-center, a fullscreen image layout can result in an eye-catching and immersive homepage design. Large media features can convey a lot about who you are and what you do in as much as a glimpse. The great thing about this layout is that it looks great on mobile devices, too. 


The visual you use can be anything from a photograph to an illustration or video. Either way, it should be high quality and relevant to your service, product or overall feel in order to take full advantage of this layout.
